# jellyfin-dvr-comskip

This is a script that is called after a video is recorded in Jellyfin Live TV. It attempts to remove the commercials using Comcut & Comskip and then converts the video using Jellyfin ffmpeg.

You can find where to put this script by going to the Server Dashboard in the Jellyfin web interface, then DVR under Live TV, then "Post-processing application:" field.

If you have updates for this script please submit a PR so everyone can benefit.
